      <description>&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://clojure.org/&#34;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; is a very interesting programming language. If you haven&#39;t checked it yet, go ahead. Apart from being a pragmatic Lisp that offers easy Java interop, it also has a nice community. So far I haven&#39;t spent as much time on the language as I would like, but I&#39;m planning to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to write a few comments about each talk of the first (ever) &lt;a href=&#34;http://clojuredays.org/&#34;&gt;Dutch Clojure Days&lt;/a&gt; event, but I just noticed that the whole conference is now available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#39;t want to watch every keynote, there&#39;s one that intrigued me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6Q8sNx95A&amp;amp;list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD&amp;amp;index=3&#34;&gt;Conversational Computing:  How Okasaki made McCarthy right yet again&lt;/a&gt;. I liked the way Michiel is trying to connect the dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you liked my recommendation and want a second one, try &lt;span class=&#34;watch-title&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34; id=&#34;eow-title&#34; title=&#34;Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ_3phggAJ8&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD&#34;&gt;Clojure for Data Science:  the good, the bad, and the ugly&lt;/a&gt;. Simon covers many nice concepts of functional programming, without being afraid to criticize the ugly parts and express his ideas on how things can be improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;watch-title&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34; id=&#34;eow-title&#34; title=&#34;Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;watch-title&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34; id=&#34;eow-title&#34; title=&#34;Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak&#34;&gt;I&#39;m very glad that I attended this conference. It was free (gratis) but thanks to the kind sponsors we had everything (coffee, muffins, and sandwiches). The venue was nice, and the location great (well, I love Amsterdam anyway). So yeah, nice work guys and until next year happy Lisping in Clojure ;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
