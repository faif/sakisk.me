From the seven databases  that are covered I was familiar with PostgreSQL and only briefly with  Neo4j. So the book gave me the chance to explore some more databases and  find out about their strengths and weaknesses. In the following  paragraphs I&#39;ll explain what I found nice and what not so nice about  each of them. Before I start: if you are planning to buy this book, I  want to warn you that some features are deprecated or even removed,  because some of the database systems have evolved since the time the  book was written (2012). For example the largest part of the Neo4j  chapter is useless, because it doesn&#39;t use the Cypher language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;PostgreSQL rocks&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s a very powerful RDBMS and I  acknowledge that since I have used it professionally. Postgres is  mature, fast, and rock-solid. For those reasons I would choose it for  all problems that play nicely with relational DBs. And yes, an RDBMS is  not the answer to all problems. For example distributed computations do  not fit well into this model. Scaling is limited to making your single  DB server/cluster more powerful by upgrading/extending its hardware. And  not all problems require full ACID compliance and strict schema  enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Riak&lt;/em&gt; is flexible. Being able to interact with a DB using a REST interface and a tool like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; should not be underestimated. What I like about Riak is that you can  store whatever resource (be it a document, an image, etc.) you like on  the fly and map it to your URL of preference. It just works! I see Riak  as a Web filesystem that supports distributed computations through  mapreduce. But Riak also supports connecting resources and traversing  between those connections (link walking). On the down side configuring,  and understanding some Riak concepts (for example conflict resolution  and adding indexes) is currently a pain. And you can only find prebuilt  binaries for your operating system (Windows is not supported at all) on basho.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;HBase&lt;/em&gt; is unusual. It takes some time to understand the way a  column-oriented DB works. What I found great is that versioning is  builtin. If you care about data history that&#39;s a big deal. Another plus:  compression and fast lookups using bloom filters are also builtin.  Great features, that can save a lot of time of development. The  negatives: no REST interface, complex configuration, and no prebuilt  binaries -- you need to compile HBase on your own, so forget Windows  unless you like pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;MongoDB&lt;/em&gt; is all about JavaScript. Having the full  support of a powerful language like Javascript while using a DB is very  valuable. Being able to save JSON documents adds a lot of flexibility  since they can nest arbitrary. But this flexibility comes with a cost:  updating a document means replacing it without a warning, deleting  specific elements of a document is not supported and debugging  JavaScript code is a pain. On the contrary: the mapreduce support of  Mongo is nice, and it also supports indexing documents. Configuring  replicas and sharding is also quite easy. And operating system support  is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;CouchDB&lt;/em&gt; is cute. The Futon Web interface makes CouchDB very user-friendly. Its REST interface and the ability to use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; makes it developer-friendly. Moreover, CouchDB has an interesting  approach regarding replication, since all servers are treated equally  (no master-slave model). The same is true for conflict resolution: one  of the conflicting updates is automatically considered the winner, and  this is consistent through all nodes. But that&#39;s not necessarily the  &#34;correct&#34; update... One last thing: CouchDB is easy to install on all  popular platforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Neo4j&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; graph database. There are  simply no competitors when it comes to modelling relationships (think of  social networks, movies, food, drinks) using graphs. Neo4j has its own  query language (Cypher) and a very nice browser that makes experimenting  easy. The documentation is also extensive and interactive. Building a  cluster is easy. The negatives: learning curve (new concepts and new  language), the enterprise edition is not free (gratis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redis&lt;/em&gt; is generic. It&#39;s not a DB as such, but more an  in-memory data structure storage toolkit. Redis is simple to use, fast,  and supports transactions. Its commands have strange names though,  probably the result of an effort to avoid verbosity. Because it is very  generic, Redis can be used as a fast in-memory cache for applications  that require high performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Final comments: Some people have proposed a better definition of the  name NoSQL: Not only SQL. I like this definition. Similar to programming  paradigms and languages, different database systems have both strengths  and weaknesses. Why not use more than one to achieve our goals? That&#39;s  the main idea behind the polyglot persistence concept, as suggested by  the authors. Polyglot persistence means using more than one databases to  target different application layers. For example Redis for caching,  Neo4j for modelling relationships, and PostgreSQL for persistence.&lt;br /&gt;              &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
