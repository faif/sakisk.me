      <description>&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;A few months ago I experienced (for the first time) how it feels to be part of a technical reviewing team. I reviewed a packt introductory &lt;a href=&#34;http://sakiskasampalis.blogspot.nl/2013/11/my-first-book-review.html&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about Design Patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I&#39;m glad to see that another packt book, of which I was for once again one of the technical reviewers, has been published. The book is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-object-oriented-python/book&#34;&gt;Mastering Object-oriented Python&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a book that focuses on writing OOP code in Python 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this book to all Python programmers, both beginners and advanced. It covers all aspects of the language (to mention a few: special methods, unit testing, decorators, serialization, etc.) and shows different possible designs, explaining the pros and cons of each design. What I really like is that the code in the book is written in a Pythonic style, and the author makes a good job at explaining how Python differs from Java/C++.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few warnings: This is a big book (~ 600 pages). You can read the whole thing, but I believe that it will be much more useful as a handbook. Also note that the book assumes familiarity with Python 3 and Design Patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might wonder why I accepted to do again a technical review. Some people find technical reviewing a waste of time. But I disagree. To become a good programmer, you need to read a lot of code instead of just writing. In fact, programmers tend to read much more existing code than write new code. If reading code is important, reading good code is much more important. And I believe that the code in this book is well written.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
