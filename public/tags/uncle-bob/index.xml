      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to watch some programming-related videos and I began with uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;keynote &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-0/show?autoplay=true&#34;&gt;The Last Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;. In  general I agree with what&#xA;he says, with one exception. Uncle Bob believes that functional programming is important&#xA;because it plays well with multicore programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this is the most important value of functional programming. First of&#xA;all, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of code written out there that is not multicore-aware. That can happen&#xA;for example when single core performance is sufficient. You can laugh as much as you want&#xA;about this statement but there are many programs where it is actually very true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
