      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sakisk.me/assets/uml.png&#34; alt=&#34;UML class diagram&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you using UML? The Unified Modeling language is a very useful notation, especially when it comes to explaining the structure and behavior of object-oriented systems. It is language-independent and offers a wide range of models/diagrams that cover the different aspects (static, dynamic, threading, etc.) of a system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like UML but I was never happy with the tooling around it. My biggest objection is that most of the UML tools use binary formats for storing the models, which makes version-controlling and collaborating for creating them impossible. That is against the nature of modern software development, which should be incremental and based on a team effort. Another thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t like is spending time on the layout of those models (e.g. rearranging boxes because they are not readable). I&amp;rsquo;d rather have the tool take care of this automatically, and only if I&amp;rsquo;m picky about something, e.g. the position of a specific box, to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
