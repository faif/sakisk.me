      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sad that there are no good programming conferences in the South of the Netherlands and especially around the Eindhoven&#xA;area which is considered very innovative and has a strong university. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&#34;http://nextbuild.nl&#34;&gt;NextBuild&lt;/a&gt; is an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2016 was the second year of the NextBuild conference. I missed the first one so I can&amp;rsquo;t comment about it, but I can say a few&#xA;things about the 2016 version. First of all it&amp;rsquo;s important to stress that this is a free (gratis) one day conference, which is&#xA;not the usual case when it comes to conferences (&lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7Bsite.url%7D%7D/2016/05/21/and-first-conference-of-year-was-dutch.html&#34;&gt;Dutch Clojure Days&lt;/a&gt; was another good exception). And even though NextBuild is free,&#xA;we were offered free coffee, juice, cookies, sandwiches, and beers. Not bad&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
